          Swami Vivekananda, born Narendranath Datta, was an Indian Hindu monk and a leading disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic and saint, Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa. He was born on January 12, 1863, in Kolkata, India.

          At a young age, Vivekananda showed great intellect and a questioning mind. He was deeply interested in spirituality and the nature of existence. His meeting with Sri Ramakrishna in 1881 marked a turning point in his life. Under the guidance of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda underwent intense spiritual practices and developed a profound understanding of Hindu philosophy, particularly Vedanta.

          After the passing of Sri Ramakrishna in 1886, Vivekananda embarked on a spiritual journey across India. He traveled extensively, experiencing the harsh realities of life and the plight of the common people. These experiences ignited a deep sense of compassion and a desire to uplift the downtrodden.
