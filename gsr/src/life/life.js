        remember that it's not defeat, but rather an opportunity for you to experience something that makes you stronger. Because life always gives you a chance to turn that loss into victory, and that last chance is the one to wait for with patience. When it comes,
        make it your own victory and make that day truly yours.
        The essence of life is the opportunity to move on, but with the remembrance of what you have lost and why,
        so that when you get another chance, it becomes truly yours. </p>
